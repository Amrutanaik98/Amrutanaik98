## 🚀 About Me

I’m a graduate student at **Northeastern University**, pursuing a **Master’s in Information Systems** (Graduating Dec 2025), with a strong foundation in software testing and a career pivot into **data engineering**. Previously, I worked at **Amdocs** where I built scalable data pipelines and visualized telecom KPIs.

I’m passionate about **ETL, big data**, and **cloud-based analytics** using tools like **ADF, Snowflake, and Power BI**.
